# Location alarm
Welcome,
_Location alarm_ is an android app that triggers an alarm at set location. This app mainly focuses on people using public transport, 
especially visually disabled/impaired (Accessibility not added yet) and kids, I found some similar apps play store but those apps just send <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationManagerCompat#IMPORTANCE_HIGH()">level-4</a> notificaiton (not alarm)
and the apps are filled with interstitial ads every other frame which is inappropriate for targeted audience.

This app is made using "Python" and not using "Java" or "Kotlin" (java version will come in future :D)

## Why app development is too slow, 
There are two main reasons affecting speed
1. College Exam:
   I'm a self-taught coder, since I unfortunately took mechanical engineering as my major, I had no option other than teaching myself.
   So whenever there is a college exam or internals, I had to take a break from coding.
2. My Laptop itself:
   The laptop I'm using to develop this app have display problem once in a hundred it will turn on properly and other 99 times have this horizontal lines which greatly affect the speed

   Even the commit 2.1.0 had serious problem having some uncommitted files, I can't help just wait till laptop supports

So if you like my effort, support me
and if you have any suggestions, please let me know, I'll appreciate it
(Some code looks weak, but I'll change while developing the app)
